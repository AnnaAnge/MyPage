## Welcome
I'm Anna. I received my B.Sc. degree in Digital Systems and my M.Sc. degree in Digital Systems Security from the University of Piraeus, Greece, in 2016 and 2018 respectively. I was also an exchange student during 2015 in Stockholm University in the department of Computer and System Sciences (DSV).  Currently, i am a PhD student in the Department of Digital Systems under the supervision of Professor Christos Xenakis while i'm also a member of the Systems Security Laboratory. My research interests are focused on cellular networks security, privacy, forensics and passwordless authentication. My most recent published work was on Forensics of Android applications.
